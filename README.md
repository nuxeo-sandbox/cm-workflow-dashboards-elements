# About Case Management Showcase Workflow Dashboards

Workflow Dashboard elements for the Nuxeo Case Management Showcase.

These are Polymer Web components.

# Requirements

Access to a the Nuxeo Case Management Showcase demo is required.

Install Node.js (I use [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)).

Navigate to the folder containing the elements in shell/terminal and then:

    npm install -g bower
    npm install -g grunt
    npm install
    bower install

# Usage

A sample application is included.

## Grunt

You can run it via:

    grunt

By default a proxy is created to localhost to handle Nuxeo authentication.  You can modify `Gruntfile.js` to change the proxy settings.

## Polyserve

You can alternatively run it via `polyserve` but you need to make a few changes:

* Enable CORS in your nuxeo application. Example CORS for polyserve:

        <extension target="org.nuxeo.ecm.platform.web.common.requestcontroller.service.RequestControllerService" point="corsConfig">
            <corsConfig name="forPolyserve" allowOrigin="http://localhost:3000">
                <pattern>/nuxeo/.*</pattern>
            </corsConfig>
        </extension>

* Install polyserve:
  * `npm install -g polyserve`
* Edit `demo/demo-wf-*.html` and modify the `<nuxeo-connection>` element with the URL for the server. For example:
  * `<nuxeo-connection url="http://localhost:8080/nuxeo"></nuxeo-connection>`
  * The user name and password can be included here as well. See the [`nuxeo-elements` documentation](https://doc.nuxeo.com/x/XJCRAQ).

Then run it:

    polyserve -p 3000

Once running, you can checkout the demo at [http://localhost:3000/components/cm-workflow-dashboards/demo](http://localhost:3000/components/cm-workflow-dashboards/demo).
